# General

Using the default multiple cdk lists and drag and drop from one to another would
also work. But then it is not possible to move nodes into another node.
Therefore the drop into the list where the elements come from is not possible
and you may only drop the into the custom dropzones that are positioned over
(absolute, z-index) the tree when dragging an element.
